# 3D-Complex-Analysis-Visuals-Python

# This collection of files is an expanded version of my final project from my MATH 215 class taken at Loyola University Chicago. I wanted to create three-dimensional graphs of #complex functions, but I did not have time to include them in the final project. These four files were done outside of class for my own interest. Please first view the power #point presentation to fully understand the complex analysis these graphs display before running the three- or two-dimensional visuals. These visuals do take some time to run.
